        <!--add some stuff about yourself-->
        <p>Hannah has only just begun her development journey. She is currently attending Lambda School's Full Stack Web Development program. As her skill improves, she becomes more and more excited to jump headfirst into the tech industry job pool. Hannah's background includes ballet (among other forms of dance), many years of experience as a barista in a local coffee shop, and most recently added to the list of hobbies/interests, roller skating. Based in Kansas City, Missouri, where Hannah grew up, she is going all in and thinking big for the future!<br>For now, Hannah is studying from her parent's house in Evergreen, Colorado, but doesn't plan on staying there for long.</p>
